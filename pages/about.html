                My Chinese name is Tsz Hin Wu. You can call me David instead. Actually, I wanted to come to Canada when I was teenager because one of my best friends went to Toronto at that time. I finally came here in 2018. I worked for a construction materials company
                in Hong Kong before I came to Vancouver. Now I am still working part- time for the company doing some paper work online. In my personal life, I have a lot of hobbies. My top three hobbies are music, movies, and cars. I love playing guitar
                so much! Any spare time I have, I will play it right away. I also enjoy watching movies, especially science fiction movies and historical ones because they inspire me and make me more knowledgeable. I am also a big fan of car racing. Such
                as F1, GT or Rally . Unfortunately, I don’t have enough time to pursue all my interests and hobbies, but that keeps me motivated to work to create free time for them. It is a great honor to have the opportunity to study with great people
                like you all; let’s help each other and improve together in the coming two years.
